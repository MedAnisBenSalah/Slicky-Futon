<!-- 
	This file is used to define an object to the game
	
	Parameters:
		- Render: Specifies the object's rendering values
			-- Shape: the model's shape
				--- Circle: The model is circle shaped (should define the radius)
				--- Rectangle: The model is rectangle (should define the size)
				--- Polygon: The model is a polygon shape (the model must include a "Body.obm" file to define the polygon's shape)
				--- PolygonParted: The model is a parted polygon shape (the model must include a "PartedSettings.xml" file to define the it's parts)
				
			-- Radius(Only used with circle shapes): The circle shape radius
			-- Size(Only used with Rectangle or Polygon shapes): The rectangle or polygon sizes
				--- x: width
				--- y: height
				
			-- Color: The entity's color
				--- r g b a: Indicates Red/Green/Blue/Alpha values respectively
				
		- Light: Specifies the object's lightening values
			-- Distance: the light's distance(size)				
			-- Alpha: The light's color alpha (the light's color will match the entity's)
				
		- Physics: Specifies the object's physics values (Unused for now)
			-- Mass: the object's mass (in KG)				
			-- Friction: The objects's friction (between 0 and 1)
			-- Restitution: The objects's restitution (between 0 and 1)
			
		- Movement: Specifies the object's movements
			-- Simple: Indicates the simple movements count				
			-- Composed: Groups the object's composed movements
				--- movement1: The first movement id (starting at 0)
				--- movement2: The second movement id (starting at 0)
				--- positionFix: This will reposition the second object in relation to the first one
